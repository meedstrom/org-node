;;; Commentary:

;; Support programmatically defining node-sequences, based on such things as
;; Org tags, time-stamps and file-names.  Then support easily navigating them.

;; Trivia: Here was a failed rename.  The concept was initally called "series",
;; not "seq", and in retrospect that was better name IMO as:
;; 1. It's less ambiguous, you don't have to clarify that you're talking
;;    about a "node seq" as oppposed to some other kind of seq.
;; 2. The name doesn't beg to be abbreviated.
;; Anyway, it's not a big enough deal to be worth changing back now.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: More API
;;  - goto latest in a seq
;;  - goto earliest
;;  - list files in a seq
;;  - get a seq w/o needing (alist-get "d" org-node-seqs () () #'equal)

(defcustom org-node-seq-defs nil
  "Alist defining each node sequence.

Each item looks like

\(KEY :name NAME
     :classifier CLASSIFIER
     :whereami WHEREAMI
     :prompter PROMPTER
     :try-goto TRY-GOTO
     :creator CREATOR
     :capture CAPTURE
     :version VERSION)

KEY uniquely identifies the sequence, and is the key to type after
\\[org-node-seq-dispatch] to select it.  It may not be \"j\",
\"n\", \"p\" or \"c\", these keys are reserved for
Jump/Next/Previous/Capture actions.

NAME describes the sequence, in one or a few words.

CLASSIFIER is a single-argument function taking an `org-node' object
and should return a list or cons cell if a sequence-item was found,
otherwise nil.

The list or cons cell may contain anything, but the first element must
be a sort-string, i.e. a string suitable for sorting on.  An example is
a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, but not in the format MM/DD/YY.

This is what determines the order of items in the sequence: after
all nodes have been processed by CLASSIFIER, the items found
are sorted by the sort-string, using `string>'.

Aside from returning a single item, CLASSIFIER may also return a list of
multiple such items.  This can be useful if e.g. you have a special type
of node that \"defines\" a sequence by simply containing links to each
item that should go into it.

Function PROMPTER may be used during jump/capture/refile to
interactively prompt for a sort-string.  This highlights the
other use of the sort-string: finding our way back from scant
context.

For example, in a sequence of daily-notes sorted on YYYY-MM-DD,
a prompter could use `org-read-date'.

PROMPTER receives one argument: the whole node-seq object, which is a
plist with the same form as one of the values in `org-node-seq-defs' but
includes two extra members :key, corresponding to KEY, and
:sorted-items, which may be useful for interactive completion.

Function WHEREAMI is like PROMPTER in that it should return a
sort-string or nil.  However, it should do this without user
interaction, and may return nil.  For example, if the user is not
currently in a daily-note, the daily-notes\\=' WHEREAMI should
return nil.  It receives no arguments.

Function TRY-GOTO takes a single argument: one of the items
originally created by CLASSIFIER.  That is, a list of not only a
sort-string but any associated data you put in.  If TRY-GOTO
succeeds in using this information to visit a place of interest,
it should return non-nil, otherwise nil.  It should not create or
write anything on failure - reserve that for the CREATOR
function.

Function CREATOR creates a place that did not exist.  For
example, if the user picked a date from `org-read-date' but no
daily-note exists for that date, CREATOR is called to create that
daily-note.  It receives a would-be sort-string as argument.

Optional string CAPTURE indicates the keys to a capture template
to autoselect, when you choose the capture option in the
`org-node-seq-dispatch' menu.

Integer VERSION indicates the definition language used for this
variable.  New sequences should use version 2, as of 2024-09-05.  When
org-node updates the seq definition language, old versions may
still work, but this is not heavily tested, so it will start printing a
message to remind you to check out the wiki on GitHub and port your
definitions."

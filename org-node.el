;;; Commentary:

;; If you were the sort of person to prefer "id:" links,
;; over "file:" links, radio-targets or any other type of link,
;; you're in the right place!

;; Now you can worry less about mentally tracking subtree hierarchies
;; and directory structures.  Once you've assigned an ID to something,
;; you can find it later.

;; The philosophy is the same as org-roam: if you assign an ID every
;; time you make an entry that you know you might want to link to from
;; elsewhere, then it tends to work out that the `org-node-find' command
;; can jump to more-or-less every entry you'd ever want to jump to.

;; That's just the core of it as described to someone not familiar with
;; zettelkasten-inspired software.  In fact, out of the simplicity
;; arises something powerful, more to be experienced than explained.

;; Compared to org-roam:

;;   + Compatible (you can use both packages and compare)
;;   + Fast
;;   + No SQLite
;;   + Never again sit through a slow `org-id-update-id-locations'
;;   + If you want, opt out of those file-level :PROPERTIES: drawers
;;     + Set `org-node-prefer-with-heading'
;;   + Try to rely in a bare-metal way on upstream org-id and org-capture
;;   + Extra utilities, notably to auto-rename files and links
;;   + An alternative way to display backlinks

;;   - No support for "roam:" links
;;   - No `org-roam-db-query'
;;     - There's an elisp API, but if you're more familiar with SQL,
;;       it's still a downgrade

;; Compared to denote:

;;   + Compatible (you can use both packages and compare)
;;   + No mandatory filename style (can match Denote format if you like)
;;   + You can have as many "notes" as you want inside one file.
;;     + You could possibly use Denote for coarse browsing,
;;       and org-node for more granular browsing.

;;   - No support for "denote:" links
;;   - No support for Markdown or other file types

;; Finally, an oddity:

;; Due to relying on the org-id table, if a vendor README.org or other
;; downloaded Org file has a heading with an ID, it's considered part of
;; your collection -- simply because of the 1:1 correspondence, that if
;; it's known to org-id, it's known to org-node.
;;
;; These headings can be filtered after-the-fact by `org-node-filter-fn',
;; so that you do not see them in org-node commands.

against the node title.

In other words: you can match against the node's outline path, if

\(Tip: users of the \"orderless\" library do not need this
setting, they can always match against the prefix and suffix via
`orderless-annotation', bound to the character \& by default.)

Another consequence: this setting can lift the uniqueness constraint on

  "Infer root directories of FILE-LIST.

By root, we mean the longest directory path common to a set of files,
as long as that directory contains at least one member of
FILE-LIST itself.  For example, if you have the 3 members

- \"/home/me/Syncthing/foo.org\"
- \"/home/kept/archive/bar.org\"
- \"/home/kept/baz.org\"

the return value will not be \(\"/home/\"), even though
the substring \"/home/\" is common to all three,
but \(\"/home/kept/\" \"/home/me/Syncthing/\").


On finding more than one root, sort by count of files they contain
recursively, so that the most populous root directory will be the first
element.

This function does not consult the filesystem, so FILE-LIST must be a
list of full paths that can be compared as strings, so e.g. there must
e.g. not be instances of substring \"~\" as well as instances of
substring \"/home/me\" referring to the same location.


For Org users, it is pragmatic to know that if FILE-LIST was the
output of something like

   \(hash-table-values org-id-locations)

  "Temporarily visit each file in FILES and call function CALL.

Take care!  This function presumes that FILES satisfy the assumptions
made by `org-node--find-file-noselect'.  This is safe if FILES is
the output of `org-node-list-files', but easily violated otherwise.

While the loop runs, print a message every now and then, composed
of MSG and a counter for the amount of files left to visit.

On running across a problem such as the auto-save being newer than the
canonical file, prompt the user to recover it using string ABOUT-TO-DO
to clarify why the file is about to be accessed, and break the loop if
the user declines.

If the user quits mid-way through the loop, or it is broken,
return the remainder of FILES that have not yet been visited.

In each file visited, the behavior is much like
`org-node--with-quick-file-buffer'.

The files need not be Org files, and if optional argument
FUNDAMENTAL-MODE is t, do not activate any major mode.

If a buffer had already been visiting FILE, reuse that buffer.
Naturally, FUNDAMENTAL-MODE has no effect in that case.

For explanation of TOO-MANY-FILES-HACK, see code comments.

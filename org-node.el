;;; Commentary:

;; What is Org-node?

;; If you were the sort of person to prefer "id:" links over "file:" links
;; or radio-targets or any other type of link, you're in the right place!

;; Now you can worry less about mentally tracking your subtree hierarchies and
;; directory structures.  As long as you've assigned an ID to something, you
;; can find it later.

;; The philosophy is the same as org-roam: if you assign an ID every
;; time you make an entry that you know you might want to link to from
;; elsewhere, then it tends to work out that the `org-node-find' command
;; can jump to more or less every entry you'd ever want to jump to.

;; Anyway, that's just the core of it as described to someone not
;; familiar with zettelkasten-ish packages.  In fact, out of the
;; simplicity arises something powerful, more to be experienced than
;; explained.

;; Compared to org-roam:

;;   - Same idea, compatible disk format
;;   - Fast
;;   - Does not need SQLite
;;   - Does not support "roam:" links
;;   - Lets you opt out of those file-level property drawers
;;   - Tries to rely in a bare-metal way on upstream org-id and org-capture
;;   - Ships extra commands to e.g. auto-rename files and links

;;   As a drawback of relying on the org-id table, if a heading in some
;;   vendor README.org or whatever has an ID, it's considered part of
;;   your collection -- simply because if it's known to org-id, it's
;;   known to org-node.
;;   These headings can be filtered after-the-fact.

;; Compared to denote:

;;   - Org only, no Markdown nor other file types
;;   - Does not support "denote:" links
;;   - Filenames have no meaning (can match the Denote format if you like)
;;   - You can have as many "notes" as you want inside one file.  You
;;     could possibly use Denote to search files and org-node
;;     as a more granular search.

  "Link types that may result in backlinks.

Of course, org-node is built around the \"id\" link type, which
corresponds to a target node\\='s ID property.  The ID property is
mandatory because it acts as a unique identifier.

However, the concept can be generalized.  Org-node also looks at the
ROAM_REFS property, which in another universe might have been called
\"EXTRA_IDS\", because in many ways it is just a list of additional IDs
for the same node.

For performance reasons, not just any string of text is accepted in the
ROAM_REFS property -- it must have valid links per Org syntax, such as
\"[[https://gnu.org]]\" or \"https://gnu.org\".
Use the command \\[org-node-ref-add] for convenience.

Finally, this variable controls which link types are permitted.
The fewer types, the faster your \\[org-node-reset].

What\\='s it actually used for: if you insert \"https://gnu.org\" in the
body text of another node, then that results in a new backlink, even
though no reference was made to a proper ID!

People often use this to write notes about a specific web-page or PDF
file, and call it a ref-node for that web-page.  See also
`org-node-try-visit-ref-node' and \\[org-node-list-reflinks].

Tip: eval `(org-link-types)' to see all built-in link types.

As a special case, citation keys such as \"@ioannidis2005\" also work in
ROAM_REFS, and correspond to citations like \"[cite:@ioannidis2005]\".
There is no need to add the \"cite\" type."

It is not necessary to exclude backups or autosaves that end in ~ or #

that end in precisely \".org\" anyway.

You can eke out a performance boost by excluding directories with a
humongous amount of files, such as the infamous \"node_modules\", even

In simple terms, let\\='s say you have configured
`org-capture-templates' so it has a template that
targets `(function org-node-capture-target)'.  Now here\\='s a
possible workflow:

1. Run `org-capture'
2. Select your template
3. Type name of known or unknown node
4a. If it was known, it will capture into that node.
4b. If it was unknown, it will create a file-level node and then
    capture into there.

Additionally, with (setq org-node-creation-fn #\\='org-capture),
commands like `org-node-find' will outsource to `org-capture' when you
type the name of a node that does not exist.  That enables this
\"inverted\" workflow:

1. Run `org-node-find'
2. Type name of an unknown node
3. Select your template
4. Same as 4b earlier."

than cut them), the remaining links in the network will
constitute a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

  "Temporarily visit each file in FILES and call function CALL.

Take care!  This function presumes that FILES satisfy the assumptions
made by `org-node--find-file-noselect'.  This is safe if FILES is
the output of `org-node-list-files', but easily violated otherwise.

While the loop runs, print a message every now and then, composed
of MSG and a counter for the amount of files left to visit.

On running across a problem such as the auto-save being newer
than the original, prompt the user to recover it using
ABOUT-TO-DO to clarify why the file is about to be accessed, and
break the loop when the user declines.

If the user quits mid-way through the loop, or it is broken,
return the remainder of FILES that have not yet been visited.

In each file visited, the behavior is much like
`org-node--with-quick-file-buffer'.

The files need not be Org files, and if optional argument
FUNDAMENTAL-MODE is t, do not activate any major mode.

If a buffer had already been visiting FILE, reuse that buffer.
Naturally, FUNDAMENTAL-MODE has no effect in that case.

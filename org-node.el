;; Created:          2024-04-13
;; Version:          0.6.0.50-git
;; Keywords:         org, hypermedia
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1") (compat "30") (dash "2.19.1") (transient "0.7.4"))
;; URL:              https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node

;;; Commentary:

;; If you were the sort of person to prefer "id:" links over "file:" links or
;; any other type of link, you're in the right place!  Now you can rely on IDs
;; and worry less about mentally tracking your subtree hierarchies and
;; directory structures.  As long as you've assigned an ID to something, you
;; can find it later.

;; The philosophy is the same as org-roam: if you assign an ID every time you
;; make an entry that you know you might want to link to from elsewhere, then
;; it tends to work out that the `org-node-find' command can jump to more or
;; less every entry you'd ever want to jump to.  Pretty soon you've forgot that
;; your files have names.

;; Anyway, that's just the core of it as described to someone not familiar with
;; zettelkasten.  In fact, out of the simplicity arises something powerful,
;; more to be experienced than explained.

;; Compared to other systems:

;; - org-roam: Same idea, compatible disk format(!), but org-node is much
;;   faster, does not depend on SQLite, lets you opt out of file-level property
;;   drawers, does not support "roam:" links, and tries to rely in a bare-metal
;;   way on upstream org-id and org-capture.  As a drawback, if a heading in
;;   some Git README has an ID, it's considered part of your collection --
;;   simply because if it's known to org-id, it's known to org-node.  These
;;   headings can be filtered after-the-fact.

;; - denote: Org-node is Org only, no Markdown, no support for "denote:" links.
;;   Filenames have no meaning (so could match the Denote format if you like),
;;   and you can have as many "notes" as you want inside one file.  You could
;;   possibly use Denote to search just files and org-node as a more granular
;;   search.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: A workflow to allow pseudo-untitled (numeric-titled) nodes
;;       - Need a bunch of commands for that, like select node by fulltext
;;         search

;; TODO: If a roam-ref exists like //www.website.com, allow counting
;;       //www.website.com?key=val&key2=val2#hash as a reflink to the same,
;;       unless the latter has a roam-ref of its own.
;;       Would have to wait until all nodes registered, then do some sort of
;;       `string-prefix-p' filtering...

It is not necessary to exclude backups or autosaves that end in ~

that end in precisely \".org\" anyway.

You can eke out a performance boost by excluding directories with
a humongous amount of files, such as \"node_modules\", even if

Each item looks like

\(KEY :name STRING
     :classifier FUNCTION
     :whereami FUNCTION
     :prompter FUNCTION
     :try-goto FUNCTION
     :creator FUNCTION)

KEY uniquely identifies the series, and is the key to type after
\\[org-node-series-dispatch] to select it.  It may not be \"j\",
\"n\" or \"p\", these keys are reserved for Jump, Next and
Previous actions.

NAME describes the series, in one or a few words.

CLASSIFIER is a single-argument function taking an `org-node'
object and should return a cons cell or list if a series-item was
found, otherwise nil.

The list may contain anything, but the first element must be a
sort-string, i.e. a string suitable for sorting on.  An example
is a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, but not in the format MM/DD/YY.

This is what determines the order of items in the series: after
all nodes have been processed by CLASSIFIER, the non-nil return
values are sorted by the sort-string, using `string>'.

Function PROMPTER may be used during jump/capture/refile to
interactively prompt for a sort-string.  This highlights the
other use of the sort-string: finding our way back from scant
context.

In the example of a series of daily-notes sorted on YYYY-MM-DD, a
simple prompter can use `org-read-date' because it returns
strings in YYYY-MM-DD format as well.

PROMPTER receives one argument, the series plist, of which an
useful member may be (plist-get series :sorted-items).

Function WHEREAMI is like PROMPTER in that it should return a
sort-string.  However, it should do this without user
interaction, and may return nil.  For example, if the user is not
currently in a daily-note, the daily-notes\\=' WHEREAMI should
return nil.  It receives no arguments.

Function TRY-GOTO takes a single argument: one of the items
originally created by CLASSIFIER.  That is, a list of not only a
sort-string but any associated data you put in.  If TRY-GOTO
succeeds in using this information to visit a place of interest,
it should return non-nil, otherwise nil.  It should not create or
write anything on failure - reserve that for the CREATOR
function.

Function CREATOR creates a place that did not exist.  For
example, if the user picked a date from `org-read-date' but no
daily-note exists for that date, CREATOR is called to create that
daily-note.  It receives a would-be sort-string as argument."

  "Insert a link to one of your ID nodes.

Unlike `org-node-insert-link', emulate `org-roam-node-insert' by
always copying any active region as initial input.

That behavior can be convenient if you often want to use the
selected region as a new node title, or you already know it
matches a node title.

On the other hand if you always find yourself erasing the
minibuffer before selecting some other node you had in mind, to
which the region should be linkified, you\\='ll prefer
`org-node-insert-link'.

The commands are the same, it is just a difference in
initial input.

On the topic of Org-roam emulation, bonus tips:

- To behave like Org-roam on node creation, set
  `org-node-creation-fn' to `org-node-new-via-roam-capture'.

- If you still find the behavior different, perhaps you had
  something in `org-roam-post-node-insert-hook'.  Configure
  `org-node-insert-link-hook' the same way."

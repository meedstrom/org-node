Seems that Debian stable will be stuck on Emacs 28 until mid-2025,
then likely leap to Emacs 30.

List of 28-isms and 29-isms to drop in future

- (cadar (org-collect-keywords "TITLE")) -> (org-get-title)
- (org-node--emacs25-strip-diacritics)
- ;;;###autoload (autoload 'org-node-series-dispatch "org-node" nil t)
  - In Emacs 30, replace with just ;;;###autoload
- any usages of compat-call
- what the compiler tells you is obsolete

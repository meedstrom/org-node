;;; Link-insertion advice

;; This logic is independent from the per-buffer validation, because that
;; operates on the file being saved -- in other words, making the file
;; navel-gaze its own content to see if it looks correct according to current
;; links tables.  Technically, that would be enough to result in correct
;; backlinks everywhere if you just run it on all files, and that's
;; more-or-less how `org-node-backlink-fix-all-files' works, but we don't want
;; to do that on every save.

;; By contrast, the below code does not look up tables, just reacts to the
;; exact link being inserted, which has two benefits:

;; 1. You can observe backlinks appearing in realtime before a buffer is saved

;; 2. It's actually necessary, because a link being inserted does not mean we
;;    should check the current file but rather visit and edit the target file.
;;    If we didn't have the below code, we'd have save the current buffer (in
;;    order to update tables) and then open the target file and run
;;    `org-node-backlink-fix-buffer', which can easily take a while for
;;    a big target file.

;;         times?  Possible the algo could be simpler, rather than diffing

(defcustom org-node-backlink-lazy nil
  "Inhibit cleaning up backlinks until user edits affected entry.

Background: Regardless of this value, links inserted via most commands
will insert a backlink in real time, so long as
`org-node-backlink-mode' is enabled.

If in the future the user deletes that link, the corresponding backlink
becomes stale.  This value controls what to do upon noticing that.

When t, they are not cleaned until you carry out some edits under the
heading that holds the stale backlink, and save that buffer.
That can be desirable for e.g. quieter git diffs.

When nil, all affected nodes are silently visited after a save if needed
to ensure that their :BACKLINKS: properties or drawers reflect reality.

To clarify, this is solely about the textual contents of :BACKLINKS:
properties or drawers; the underlying link tables are up to date anyway.

Minor side effect: `org-element-cache-reset' is called in the buffers
where backlinks are fixed.

To force an update at any time, use one of these commands:

- \\[org-node-backlink-mass-update-drawers]
